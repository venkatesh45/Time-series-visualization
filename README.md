                                                 Time Series Visualisation
                                                 main page of my project which contains a  united state map and also a line graph with X
                                                 and Y axis. with X axis representing years and Y axis the unemployment rate.

                                                  for every state when clicked on a map you can find a unemployment rate graph from 1978 
                                                  to 2016.

                                                 This would show the multiple state unemployment rate graph for comparision.

                                                 for every graph when you mouseover you could see the three values that are year state name and unemployment rate of particular year.

                                                 unemployment rate of every state in monthly manner from 1978 to 2016 using slider

                                                 All the states unemployment rate at once.

                                                 we can go through the graph using rise button by giving some percent of increase so that only the sates that have a rise of unemployment rate by that percent are pumped.

                                               the same way of rise the drop function pumps only those states that are dropped by certain unemployment rate from previous year.
